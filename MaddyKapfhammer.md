### Hi - My name is Madelyn, but you can call me Maddy!

I am a software engineer at CEI, but more importantly, I am the GitHub training lead of our GitHub practice team! I enjoy teaching developers about GitHub, GitHub Copilot, GitHub Actions, and more! I am passionate about learning, teaching, and sharing knowledge with others. I am excited to share my knowledge with you all today!
